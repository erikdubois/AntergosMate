# AntergosCinnamon

Antergos with the latest Cinnamon edition.


This is my configuration for Cinnamon to be used on the Antergos distribution.

I wrote an installation document "read_me_installation_antergos_ base_vx" to cover some specific issues.

# What can you achieve?

On the far right you see the conky "Aurora" hosted on Sourceforge.

#What can you do if the script does not execute?

Since I sometimes forget to make the script executable, I include here what you can do to solve that.

A script can only run when it is marked as an executable.

	ls -al 

Above code will reveal if a script has an "x". X meaning executable.
Google "chmod" and "execute" and you will find more info.

For now if this happens, you should apply this code in the terminal and add the file name.

	chmod +x typeyourfilename

Then you can execute it by typing

	./typeyourfilename



# A N T E R G O S and  A R C H L I N U X
-------------------------------------------------

I started using Archlinux as a learning experience. I have tried installing all kinds of desktop environments (DE) and formatted many times my ssd's to start from scratch. Then I started exploring other distro's based on Archlinux. After a while it was more practical to have a script of some kind to record the knowledge and to automate the things I had already learned. They became repetitive in nature.

The goal is to be quickly up and running after a clean install. 

That's why I have written a script to do just that. 

#1. Installation of the ANTERGOS system

Download the iso and burn it on a cd or use an usb.

USB

	sudo fdisk -l
	sudo dd bs=4M if=/path/to/antergos.iso of=/dev/sdX &&  sync


	or

	sudo packer -S imagewriter

Cdrom

	use brasero, xfburn or others

During this installation you will have to choose your desktop environment (DE). 

At the time of writing you can choose

	- base installation (no DE)
	- GNOME
	- kde
	- cinnamon
	- mate
	- xfce4
	- openbox

This page is about installing Cinnamon.



#2. Installation via script

I run an installation script to quickly  get all my software after the installation of Antergos. For me this was quite a learning process, since I was a Redhat, Ubuntu, Linux Mint kind of guy over the last two decades. You will probably see this in my selection of software.

The idea is to download (if you have internet connection) the i3 github files :

	sudo pacman -S git
	git clone https://github.com/erikdubois/AntergosCinnamon

This folder that you will download will give you all the installation scripts necessary to fully install the desktop.

Change, delete and append whatever you want.

I decided to split the logical entities in seperate files or logical entities. Better to debug and better for users to understand.

The scripts have been numbered from 1 to 6. Follow the orderering to install all programs.


    
y
    ./1_install_packer_vx.sh

This will install the program packer. It is a wrapper for yaourt which is already installed. Packer will serve as the aur helper from there on.




    ./2_install_arch_repo _vx.sh

This will install all programs coming from the "normal" arch repositories with the use of pacman.
During the process you will have to type the password for vnstat.




    ./3_install_aur_repo _vx.sh

This will install all programs coming from the AUR repositories.

If you see a program, you do not want. Just press ENTER and no number and it will be skipped.
In the script you will see a text to know which one you need to choose.

    For example

    echo "################################################################"
    echo "spotify"
    echo "################################################################"



When that is done you run




    ./4_zsh_vx.sh

The zsh script is an alternative for "bash" more colourfull (>100 themes) and more plugins then you ever need.





    ./5_smb_vx.sh

The smb script is to install samba or the way to share folders and files between computers if you need it.


# Themes and icons

All theming for both archlinux and ubuntu based systems are hosted here :

You can also use the Sardi icon theme:

You can do whatever <b>Y O U</b> want.

Share the knowledge.
